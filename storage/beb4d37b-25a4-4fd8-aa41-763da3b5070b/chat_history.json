Unfortunately, I encountered an issue (the same as indicated in the recent chat history regarding `models/gemini-1.5-flash` not being found) that prevented me from generating a detailed, LLM-based description for 'sample_sales_data.csv'.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the structural information that was successfully extracted:\n\nYour dataset 'sample_sales_data.csv' contains 200 rows and 7 columns:\n- **Date**: object (e.g., '2025-01-01')\n- **Product**: object (e.g., 'Monitor', 'Tablet')\n- **Region**: object (e.g., 'West', 'North')\n- **Sales_Rep**: object (e.g., 'Alice')\n- **Units_Sold**: int64 (e.g., 26, 42)\n- **Revenue**: float64 (e.g., 2791.14, 5418.47)\n- **Discount**: float64 (e.g., 0.28, 0.18)\n\nWould you like me to proceed with a basic analysis using this available information, or would you prefer to try again for a richer description once the underlying technical issue is resolved?",
